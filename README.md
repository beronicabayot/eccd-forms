# ECCD Information Page

## Overview

This project is a part of the Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) system designed to collect and manage essential information related to child development centers. The Information Page allows users to enter and submit general information about a Child Development Center/Learning Center for assessment, recognition, and licensing purposes.

## Features

- **Form Fields**: Users can provide detailed information about their child development center, including:
  - Status of Application (New, Re-Application, Renewal)
  - Source of Funds (e.g., National Government Agency, Local Government Unit)
  - General information about the center, such as its name, address, and contact details.
  - Detailed data about the child development teacher/worker and supervising focal person.
  
- **Responsive Design**: The page is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Conditional Fields**: Depending on user input (such as choosing "Others" for the source of funds), additional fields appear dynamically for further information.

- **Submission & Redirection**: Upon submission, the form alerts the user and redirects to a thank-you page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the page and form elements.
- **CSS (via Tailwind CSS)**: Styling the layout and ensuring responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Form handling, including showing/hiding fields based on user input.
